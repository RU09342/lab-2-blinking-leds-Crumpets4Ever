README_MULTIPLE_BLINK
The Multiple Blink code was modified from the given simple blink. 
Initially I tried to toil with delay cycles, that proved unfruitful as it delayed both LEDs' blink rate. 
In the end using 2 if statements with two ints counting up and then being reset when the if statement is fulfilled was the best implemented.
