README_SIMPLE_BLINK
Author: Ben Jukus
Most pretty much all of the code was taken from Resource Explorer.
Resource Explorer code was found by typing in the Part number.
Going to "Software" -> "Peripherals" -> "Register Level" -> First File typically. 

The code for simple blink was modified very little. Delays were modified using different types and changing the rate, for loop, "__delay_cycles", and if statements were used. The LED doing the blinking was modified, changing from the red to the green(Green is a nicer color). 
Despite minor modifications simple blink code remained nearly identical to source code, and is accredited as such.
